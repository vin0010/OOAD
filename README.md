# OOAD
- Learnings from https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/java-fundamentals-object-oriented-design

## Simplicity
- The code should do exactly what's necessary, nothing more
- For any problem, go for simpler solution, if it needs to be modified in some time again, go for a better design pattern since it will have make further modification easier(Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me)
- Using Design patterns in every place is not a good idea, use it in places where you are going to modify code more than once.    
- Design incrementally, Build incrementally(imagine constructing multiple houses in apartment, dont go for painting in the first place after finishing the one side wall).
